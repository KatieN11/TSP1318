    <br />
    <p>
      Vancouver night 3... closing night... was my best friend's 18th birthday.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>and, for once, the ticketmaster queue was on our side</p>
    <br />
    <p>the logistics were a nightmare</p>
    <br />
    <p>but, somehow, all the stars aligned</p>
    <br />
    <p>so here we were, one more time....</p>
    <br />
    <p>thank you...</p>
